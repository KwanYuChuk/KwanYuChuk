😄 My top 1 CliftonStrength is "Learner". I have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning rather than the outcome excites me.

🔭 I’m currently working as a casual GIS technician in a soil carbon company.

💻 I usually use R programming, python and a little bit JavaScript.

⚡ Fun fact: I gave mathematics tutorials to financially-difficulty student. Later this student got scholarship and bachelor's position from a university in Hong Kong. I'm proud of her and me.
